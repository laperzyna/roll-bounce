Hi Clay!!

I do want to just start by saying I had so much more fun doing this project over Nonogram, so thank you to whoever for assigning something colorful, haha.
I'm using this ReadMe file just to explain that my code isn't 100% right. My balls bounce perfectly fine, the only thing is instead of eventually settling they increase in speed and bounce forever and I'm not sure why. I asked on campuswire but was still confused as the prof mentioned it might have something to do with the x and y corrinates but I really don't understand. I really messed with this code for a long time trying to figure it out, switching and adding a bunch of code but couldn't get rid of this bug. I'm hoping to see the solution because I think once I fix that bug my code will work the way it's supposed to. Besides that, this was a big step up for me from the last project and I'm happy with it either way.
