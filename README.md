## Description
This application is coded in Java and reads from a prop file to grab the specifications of each bouncing ball, such as friction, number of balls, velocity, etc. This application also applies the rules of physics and laws of motion to each ball as well as mathmatics and planes for the canvas. 

## Future Development
Currently, there is a bug in this program that makes the balls bounce forever instead of settling and I am currently working to fix this bug.

## Process
I really enjoyed working with this program and using a canvas and color properties to create a very cool but simple program. I hope that I can get this application to work correctly.
